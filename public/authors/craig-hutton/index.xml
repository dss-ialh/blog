Column separation during pivotinglibrary(magrittr)library(dplyr)library(tidyr)Consider a tibble in a wide form:
ds &amp;lt;- tibble::tribble(~ person_id, ~height_cm_1, ~heigh_cm_2, ~weight_kg_1, ~weight_kg_2,1, 160, 170, 67, 78,2, 155, 168, 56, 61)ds## # A tibble: 2 x 5## person_id height_cm_1 heigh_cm_2 weight_kg_1 weight_kg_2## &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;## 1 1 160 170 67 78## 2 2 155 168 56 61Many graphing and modeling tasks will require ds to be transformed into a tidy form:</description>

      <description>Being able to work with character strings is an essential skill in data analysis and science. In this post we’ll learn a few of the ways in which the stringr package and regular expressions (AKA “regex” or “regexps”) makes working with strings in R considerably easier.

      <description>Out in the real world you may often find yourself working with data from multiple sources. It will probably be stored in separate files and you’ll need to combine them before you can attempt to answer any of your research questions. Click here to learn how you can combine data frames using a set of dplyr functions called joins.</description>

      <description>The 4th post in the Scientist’s Guide to R series introduces data transformation techniques useful for wrangling/tidying/cleaning data. Specifically, we will be learning how to use the 6 core functions (and a few others) from the popular dplyr package, perform similar operations in base R, and chain operations with the pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%) to streamline the process.

      <description>As the third post in the Scientist’s Guide to R series (click here for the 1st post), we advance to the brink of the next major stage of the data analysis with R process: cleaning and transforming data. However, before we can clean or transform anything we will need to know how to do a few basic things and familiarize ourselves with some common data structures in R, which are the topics of this post.</description>
