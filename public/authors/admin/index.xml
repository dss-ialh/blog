      <description>The Data Science Studio (DSS) was formed to promote sound practices of longitudinal modeling in health research and facilitate collaboration between academic researchers and health sytem organizations. This working group was conceived and launched by Ken Moselle, Scott Hofer, and Andriy Koval.
In fall 2014, Scott Hofer organized a colloquium series at the Institute on Aging and Lifelong Health - then “Centre on Aging” - with focus on reproducible methods and applications in aging research.</description>
