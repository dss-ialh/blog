      <description>Sometimes you know more about modelling the population you are studying than you do about the parameters feeding your models. Suppose your population has unknown birth rate \(\gamma\), and survival probability \(\omega\). You have a model incorporating these two parameters. You can use your model and data observations to estimate \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\). But how precise are these estimates? Are they biased? How many observations should you collect? Simulation studies are here to help answer those questions!</description>
