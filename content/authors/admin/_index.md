Institute on Aging and Longlife Health (IALH) works with data from the residents of Vancouver Island related to their cognitive and physical aging. Augmenting these data  with  medical history collected by Island Health presents a unique opportunity to explore human aging through the big data of clinical context. Data Science Studio was formed to assist UVic researchers to gain access to the electronic health records (EHR) of Island Health and to promote sound practices of longitudinal modeling in their analysis. This working group (DSS) was conceived and launched by Ken Moselle, Scott Hofer, and Andriy Koval.

In the Fall of 2014, Scott Hofer organized a colloquium series of IALH - then “Center on Aging” -  with the focus on reproducible methods and applications in aging research. Andriy Koval, his new postdoc at the time, volunteered to give a series of talks on the use of R and common techniques of reproducible analytics with dynamic documents. (link 1). Ken Moselle, Enterprise Information Architect of Island Health, attended these lecture series, seeking ways to tap into statistical expertise of UVic to nurse analytical capacities of Island Health. A unique, cross-continuum EHR system of Island Health has been amassing records since 2007, capturing an almost complete longitudinal picture of patients within the health system. However, despite the allure of their interoperability and longitudinal nature,  these data did not contribute much to the evidentiary basis of existing policies.Their broad, cross-continuum breadth of health services and a high complexity of statistical models needed to handle “within-person-over-time” patterns was calling for analytic capacities beyond the scope of Quality Improvement shops within Island Health. The colloquium sparked a vision for a working group that would bring together the expertise capable of releasing the potential of big, cross-continuum EHR for aging research: knowledge of clinical context (Ken),  statistical expertise in modeling individual differences (Scott) and applied data science skills for handling big data (Andriy).

In the Fall of 2015, Ken formed Applied Clinical Research Unit at Island Health. Scott has funded Andriy to join half-time, to work on rendering VIHA’s EHR into a form in which they can be analyzed and linked to the aging data collected by IALH.  Ken and Andriy developed a Clinical Coding Scheme (CCCS, see link 2), a system for reducing the granularity of Island Health service landscape. One of the first application of CCCS was development of “patient timelines” for DEPiCTS projects, co-chaired by Scott, which visualised service utilisation in the longitudinal context of visiting Stroke Rapid Assessment Unit (figure 1, optional). Building on this methodology, Andriy and Ken developed a research proposal for developing a severity scaling method for  Mental Health and Substance Use (MHSU) conditions based on the service utilisation data of Island Health, which won Andriy a CIHR’s Health System Impact Fellowship with BCCDC in the Fall of 2017.

Since Spring of 2018, in partnership with the Observatory for Population and Public Health of BCCDC, Ken, Scott, and Andriy launched a series of regular meetings at IALH, providing a forum for UVic researchers and Island Health analysts, program leaders, and administrators. The name of the working group was chosen to highlight the three aspects of service that Data Science Studio aimed to provide. Ken helps with the protocol submission and navigation within the service landscape of Island Health(Data). Scott advises on the longitudinal methodology and aging research (Science). Andriy promotes skills of reproducible analytics, intelligent programming, and data visualisation (Studio).  The first season culminated in the Institute’s colloquium series (link 2)  on “Displaying Health Data” in November 2018, where DSS showcased latest activities.  

By the start of February 2019, Data Science Studio helped develop over 10 research protocols, half of which has been submitted to Island Health and are currently under review. For their second season of operation, DSS hopes to finalise and launch the new Controlled Data Disclosure Environment (CDDE), which would respond to data requests of submitted research protocols for the access to the encounter and diagnostic data.
