# Exponent Summary

_by [Matthew Parker](https://matthew-parker.rbind.io/)_

Log space is used for higher precision

```{r}
dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000) # sample from a Poisson Distribution
dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000, log=T)
```


This is good for multiplication: `log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b)`
```{r}
dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000)^2
2*dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000, log=T)
```

But it fails for addition: `log(a+b)=?` 

For example, if we want to calculate `a + b`, but only have accurate `log(a)` and `log(b)`:
 
 `a + b = exp(log(a)) + exp(log(b))`

In this case, exponentiation destroys precision!
```{r}
dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000, log=T)
exp(dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000, log=T))
```

So how can we calculate:
```{r}
dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000) + dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000)
```

__Solution__: keep the largest part in log space!

suppose a >= b:   
`log(a + b) =`   
           `= log(exp(log(a)) + exp(log(b)))`  
           `= log( exp(log(a)) * (1+exp(log(b)/log(a))) )`    
           `= log( exp(log(a)) ) + log( 1+exp(log(b)-log(a))) )`   
           `= log(a) + log1p( exp(log(b)-log(a)) )`    

Let's define the function to accomplish this task

```{r}
logSumExp <- function(x) {
  if(all(is.infinite(x))) { return(x[1]) }
  x = x[which(is.finite(x))]
  ans = x[1]
  for(i in seq_along(x)[-1]) {
    ma = max(ans,x[i])
    mi = min(ans,x[i])
    ans = ma + log1p(exp(mi-ma))
  }
  return(ans)
}
```

and demonstrate its use:

```{r}
x = c(dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000, log = T), 
      dpois(x = 5, lambda = 1000, log = T))
logSumExp(x)
```
Voila, the precision is preserved!


# Axis labels

```

When faceting a plot, we may need to place axis labels on each facet (especially if we have many of them):

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=disp, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~cyl, ncol=1)
```

One way of achieving this is to use `scale = "free_x"` argument, but if data on the faceted levels covers different ranges of values, the limits of the scale will be adjusted:
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=disp, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  # facet_wrap(~cyl, ncol=1) 
  facet_wrap(~cyl, ncol=1, scales = "free_x") # puts tick marks, but distorts scale
  
```

Comes in the `lemon` package, which provides functions `facet_rep_wrap()` and `facet_rep_grid()` to offer exactly this flexibility. 
You can also use the arguments you  normally pass to `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`, respectively:
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=disp, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  # facet_wrap(~cyl, ncol=1) 
  # facet_wrap(~cyl, ncol=1, scales = "free_x") # puts tickmarks, but distorts scale
  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(~cyl,ncol=1, repeat.tick.labels = TRUE)
```


# Tidy Evals

library(lemon)
```

When turning your ggplots into functions, we can use `aes_string` function to pass quoted strings as variable names: 

```{r message=F, warning=F}
make_faceted_scatter <- function(d,xvar,yvar){
  mtcars %>% 
    ggplot(aes_string(x=xvar, y = yvar))+
    geom_point()
}
mtcars %>% make_faceted_scatter("disp","mpg")
```

However, passing an unquoted variable names to function required resorting to `rlang` package to translate bares (unquoted names) to quosures in functions:
  
```{r include=FALSE}
make_faceted_scatter <- function(d,xvar,yvar){
  xvar_enquo <- rlang::enquo(xvar)
  yvar_enquo <- rlang::enquo(yvar)
  mtcars %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=!!xvar_enquo, y = !!yvar_enquo))+
    geom_point()
}
mtcars %>% make_faceted_scatter(disp,mpg)
```

Unfortunately, this did not play well with facets. However, since  `0.4.0` version, `rlang` provides a shortcut for this implementation using `{{}}`, which pairs up with the new (`ggplot2 3.0.0`) helper function `vars()` in `facet_wrap()` to make it work: 
  
```{r}
make_faceted_scatter <- function(d,xvar, yvar,fvar){
  mtcars %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x={{xvar}}, y = {{yvar}}))+
    geom_point()+
    lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars({{fvar}}),ncol=1, repeat.tick.labels = TRUE)
}
mtcars %>% make_faceted_scatter(disp,mpg,cyl)
```


# Auto-referening in plots

library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


When building `ggplot2` objects we might need to build a layer that uses only a subset of the sourced data. For example, in a scatterplot of `mpg` and `disp` among 4-cylinder cars

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(cyl == 4) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = disp ))+
      geom_point(shape = 1,  size =4)
```
we may want to highlight only those with 5 gears. This could be accomplished by passing `data =` to the extra geom that would draw the highlight:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(cyl == 4) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = disp ))+
      geom_point(shape = 1,  size =4)+
      geom_point(shape = 20, size = 4,data = mtcars %>% filter(cyl==4, gear == 5))
```

This approach, however, has a major disadvantage: you have to repeat the transformations (in this case only `filter`) that take place between the source data and the `ggplot2` canvas. `ggplot2 3.0.0` offers a more elegant solution by surrounding the `ggplot` canvas in `{}` and using `.` placeholder to refer to the data set that was passed to `aes()`:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(cyl == 4) %>%
  {# ! notice !
    ggplot(.,aes(x = mpg, y = disp ))+
      geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4)+
      geom_point(shape = 20, size = 4,color = "salmon", data = . %>% filter(gear == 5))
  }# ! notice !
```
