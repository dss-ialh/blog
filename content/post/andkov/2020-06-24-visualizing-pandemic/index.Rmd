Recently I was invited to give a workshop  at the 2020 Summer School event of the [Visual and Automated Disease Analytic](http://vada.cs.umanitoba.ca/program/) (VADA) graduate training program. My workshop focused on visualizing COVID-19 data in multiple countries, demonstrating how to 1) build interactive visualizations  using `plotly::ggplotly()`, 2) compute relative timelines for each country and 3) plot sequence of key events for cross-country comparison. To structure the workshop and create the criteria of success/progress, I have broken down the session into three parts, each aimed at producing a graphic.

|Goal 1| Goal 2| Goal 3|
|---|---|---|  
|Timeseries with interactive highlights|Trajectories with relative timelines| Sequence of key epidemiological events|
