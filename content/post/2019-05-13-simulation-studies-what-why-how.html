<p>Sometimes you know more about modelling the population you are studying than you do about the parameters feeding your models. Suppose your population has unknown birth rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, and survival probability <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. You have a model incorporating these two parameters. You can use your model and data observations to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. But how precise are these estimates? Are they biased? How many observations should you collect? Simulation studies are here to help answer those questions!</p>
