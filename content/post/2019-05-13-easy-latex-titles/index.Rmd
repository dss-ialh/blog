summary: The post demonstrates how to create Latex titles for reproducible graphs.  

abstract: Ever wanted to add LATEX to your R plots? Well now you can, with tikz, and it will allow you to use LATEX code within your plot titles, labels, and annotations. We’re going to look at how to use LATEX (text formating, formulas, fractions, greek letters, etc) with your ggplot data visualizations. We will be using the rtikzDevice package for R (and to use your plots in LATEX, you will use the package tikz).
