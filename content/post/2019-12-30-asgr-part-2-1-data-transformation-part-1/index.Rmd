The 4th post in the [Scientist's Guide to R series](https://craig.rbind.io/post/2019-05-17-asgr-basic-workflow/) introduces data transformation techniques useful for wrangling/tidying/cleaning data. Specifically, we will be learning how to use the 6 core functions (and a few others) from the popular [dplyr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8) package, perform similar operations in base R, and chain operations with the pipe operator (`%>%`) to streamline the process. Click [here](https://craig.rbind.io/post/2019-12-30-asgr-2-1-data-transformation-part-1/) for the full post.
