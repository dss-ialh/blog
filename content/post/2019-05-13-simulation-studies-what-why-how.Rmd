Sometimes you know more about modelling the population you are studying than you do about the parameters feeding your models. Suppose your population has unknown birth rate $\gamma$, and survival probability $\omega$. You have a model incorporating these two parameters. You can use your model and data observations to estimate $\gamma$ and $\omega$. But how precise are these estimates? Are they biased? How many observations should you collect? Simulation studies are here to help answer those questions!
