<p>This post dives into the <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/elucidate">elucidate</a> package and how it can help you explore data using sets of functions for interrogating, describing, visualising, interacting with, and correcting data. This is a key stage of any analysis where errors are found and interesting relationships begin to appear.
