summary: Target Information Architecture (TIA) is an graphical rendering of answers to a series of linked questions relating to analytic products from data to support the functions performed by persons, providers or programs within a health system. We argue that a developed TIA is a necessary condition to guide the translation of health service analytics back into a health service system.
